Wolfram Mathematica notebooks with examples illustrating the methods for approximation of envelopes of generalized planar swept volumes by circular arcs introduced in 

J. Vráblíková and B. Jüttler, **Arc spline approximation of envelopes of evolving planar domains**, Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, Volume 483, 2026, [link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2026.117372).


**Content**:
* **envelopes_of_worms.nb** illustrates four methods for approximation of boundaries of cyclographic images of curves in the Minkowski space by circular arcs.
* **free_form_domain_envelope_superset.nb** approximates a superset of the envelope of an evolving planar domain by arc splines.
* **Functions.wl** contains functions used in the above files.
